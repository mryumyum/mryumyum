Im currently interested in machine learning and its uses in data analysis for scientific endeavors. 
The hot topic right now is neural networks especially convolutional neural networks, but other models such as decision trees, random forest, and even linear regression have their uses.
Im just looking to get my feet wet with large data sets really, you can find me here or on linked in: https://www.linkedin.com/in/zach-e-gregory/
